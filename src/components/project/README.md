# Project Management Structure

This folder structure supports multiple projects and is scalable for future growth.

## Current Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── project/           # Project-specific components
│   │   └── ProjectSelector.tsx
│   ├── dashboard/         # Dashboard components (shared across projects)
│   ├── grid/             # Data grid components (shared across projects)
│   ├── layout/           # Layout components (shared across projects)
│   └── ui/               # UI components (shared across projects)
├── pages/
│   ├── project-tracker/  # Project Tracker page
│   └── document-monitor/ # Document Monitor page
├── stores/
│   └── projectStore.ts   # Centralized project and document management
└── types/
    └── project.ts        # Project and document type definitions
```

## Future Scalability

The current structure is designed to easily support:

1. **Multiple Projects**: Each project has its own documents and data
2. **Project-specific Components**: Components can be created in `src/components/project/`
3. **Shared Components**: Dashboard, grid, and UI components are shared across projects
4. **Centralized State**: All project data is managed in a single store
5. **Easy Extension**: New project types or features can be added without major refactoring

## Benefits

- **Scalable**: Easy to add new projects and features
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Reusable**: Shared components reduce code duplication
- **Flexible**: Can easily add project-specific customizations
